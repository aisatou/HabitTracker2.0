# README

Ever felt like there's so much to do, but with nothing to help you keep track of it?

Well look no further! This simple to-do list helps you get it all covered! You can also check off when you're done completing a task, whether it be a chore, extracurricular activity, or a workout at the gym!

This app was built using Ruby on Rails.

To run it, you fork the repository, clone it, and also make sure to run 'bundle install' in your terminal, just in case if you're missing any gems. Next, run 'rails s' in your terminal. Once you do that, you run 'open index.html' in your terminal and voila!

Happy list creating!
